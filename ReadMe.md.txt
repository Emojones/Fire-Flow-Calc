This little ditty is for firefighters or planners who need to use ISO requirements to calculate the required gallons per minute that would be needed to put out a fire at a buildling and is typically part of the preplanning.

I've err'd on the side of caution with some of the coefficeints to keep the app simple but accurate after rounding.
